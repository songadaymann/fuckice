# Gamelogic Extensions

Version 4.3.0

This package contains a collection of useful utilities and extensions for Unity. 

## Getting Started Quickly
The easiest way to get started is to work through the examples in the examples folder:
`Gamelogic/Extensions/Examples`.

## Samples
* All samples depend on the SharedResources sample, so always import that first. 
* Samples rely on UGUI and Sprite 2D. Extensions itself does not require these. (We want to remove this dependency, 
and would love to hear from users whether this is an issue.x)
