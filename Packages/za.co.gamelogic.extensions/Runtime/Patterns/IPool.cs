	/// <typeparam name="T">The type of the objects to pool. </typeparam>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Unity introduced its own pool objects in Unity 2020. The built-in pool is similar to the one provided here,
	/// but this interface gives a bit more control over managing objects.
	///
	/// Here are some differences:
	///	- Unity pools do not allow you to specify the creation or destruction of pool objects.
	///	- Unity pools do not allow you to specify activation and deactivation actions.
	///	- Unity pools do not offer ways to manage the capacity of the pool explicitly.
	///
	/// What pool should I use?
	///	- If your objects are safe to be hashed, use <see cref="HashPool{T}"/>.
	///	- Otherwise, if your pool capacity is low, use <see cref="Pool{T}"/>.
	///	- Otherwise, use the pool returned by <see cref="PoolExtensions.GetHashPool{T}" />.
	///
	/// When should I use a pool?
	///	- When allocations of objects are expensive, such as creating game objects in the scene.
	///	- When you do a lot of allocations and de-allocations of the same type of object, such as in custom a particle
	/// system
	///
	/// We have several examples of how you can use our pools to build more sophisticated pools:
	/// [Custom Pools](../content/custom_pools.md).
	/// </remarks>
