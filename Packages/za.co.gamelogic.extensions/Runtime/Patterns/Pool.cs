	/// <summary>
	/// A light-weight pool class for objects that cannot be hashed.
	/// </summary>
	/// <typeparam name="T">The type of the objects to pool. Since the methods defined by the interface would
	/// copy instances of pool objects if <typeparamref name="T"/> was a struct, <typeparamref name="T"/> must be a
	/// <see langword="class" />.</typeparam>
	/// <remarks>
	/// When the pool is created, it is filled up to capacity with objects that are newly created. A pool object can be
	/// active or inactive. When an object is active, it can be used by the client. When it is inactive, it should not be
	/// used, but the system has no checks for this. Objects are set to inactive when they are created for the first
	/// time. 
	///
	/// To get an object that you can use, call <see cref="Get"/>. This will activate one of the pool objects up for
	/// your use.
	///
	/// When you are done with it, call <see cref="Release"/>. This will deactivate the object, and allow it to
	/// be reused.
	///
	/// Acquiring an object or releasing it does not destroy or create any objects, and pool objects always remain in
	/// the pool unless the capacity is reduced. 
	///
	/// We recommend implementing a bool isActive field in the object you want to pool, and maintain it in the activate
	/// and deactivate actions you provide in the constructor. You can then perform asserts in your code on this field to
	/// ensure you do not accidentally use objects that are inactive. 
	/// </remarks>
	/// <seealso cref="HashPool{T}"/>
	/* Design note: we _could_ enforce T to implement a certain interface, and provide and maintain the isActive field
		described automatically. However, we did not want to impose any constraints on pool objects.
		
		A better name for this class would be `DefaultPool` so we could use Pool for static methods (including factory 
		methods that could give you different pools more conveniently). Since this is a very old class though, I did not
		want to rename it. :/
