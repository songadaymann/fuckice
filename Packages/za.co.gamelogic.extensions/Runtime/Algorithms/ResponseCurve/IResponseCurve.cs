	/// <para>The inputs need not be spread uniformly.</para>
	/// <para>You can implement this interface directly, or use the

	/// <para>It can make sense to implement this interface for discrete types, although often broader concept is needed,
	/// making this interface unsuitable. For example, you could implement a class <c>InRange</c> that maps inputs to
	/// <see langword="true"/> if they are in a given range, and <see langword="false"/> otherwise. But this class would
	/// make sense for other inputs than float too, so limiting it by implementing this interface is not good.</para>
