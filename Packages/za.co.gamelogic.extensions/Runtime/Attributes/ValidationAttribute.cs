				Why is this editor code in the attribute?
				- This makes it the easiest to add new validation attributes that work.

				Why not avoid using serialized property so we do not have to include editor code in the attributes?
					- These alternatives have been considered:
						- Duplicating the SerializedProperty class for runtime code. This seems like a very
						drastic approach, and may be difficult to maintain as Unity continues adding new types
						to support.
						- Using a generic method, like IsValid<T>, and doing the conversion to the type from the serialized
						property. However, this is surprisingly tricky for lists and compound types, and after an initial attempt
						this strategy was abandoned. Besides, this method requires a lot of unnecessary boxing.
					Weighing up the pros and cons, it seems that the current approach is the best one.
